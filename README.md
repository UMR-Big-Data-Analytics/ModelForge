## üìã Overview

ModelForge is an advanced system for clustering and consolidating machine learning models. It efficiently reduces a large collection of models into a smaller set of representative models while preserving performance characteristics.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Model Clustering** - Group similar models based on performance metrics and characteristics
- **Model Consolidation** - Generate a smaller, representative set of models from the original collection
- **Performance Evaluation** - Comprehensively evaluate consolidated models against the original set
- **Visualization Tools** - Analyze model similarities and differences through intuitive visualizations

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- Poetry (dependency management)

### Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/modelforge.git
cd modelforge
poetry install
```

### Quick Usage
